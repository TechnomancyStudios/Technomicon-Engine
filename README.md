# Technomicon-Engine
The Official Technomancy Studios Engine

This is the Technomicon Engine. It's nothing special, but it will be the engine we will be using, hopefully, from now on.
This is a [BIG] work in progress. So changes will be happening. Also the code will look ugly.

Currently we are using SDL 2.0 with SDL_Img and SDL_Mixer as dependencies, so if you are brave enough to build it make sure you have those.

## Current Features!
  - Basic Sprite Handling
  - Basic Audio Playback
  - Really Basic Autotiling
  - Chip-8 Emulator

## Future Features!
  - Level Editor
  - Entities
  - Advance Audio Mixing
  - 2D Collisions
  - Video Playback
  - Better Input Handling
  - Shaders
  - 3D Support
  - And whatever else we need.
